## Problem Statement

Auto Correction on Text Area
Problem Statement - Create a react app that gives the user the ability to enter some text on the screen and autocorrect the word in case it is spelled wrong. Keep a dictionary of words that will help with finding the correct words.

Technologies: React

Example Dictionary of words:

| Incorrect word| Correct word  |
|---------------|---------------|
|    smple      |    sample     |
|    cours      |    course     | 
| corespondence | correspondence|
|   alphbet     |   alphabet    |


## Steps to run the app

1. Clone the project and cd into it.
2. Run the following command
```
yarn install
```
3. Run the following command
```
yarn start
```

## Limitations

The app currently supports very crude autocorrection for 10 words, and this autocorrection will currently work only if the incorrect words in the list are typed correctly ironically.
The words you can get autocorrected are:
helo, wrld, smpl, crse, corespondence, alfabet, cal, asinment, brek

I will attempt to make this better.
